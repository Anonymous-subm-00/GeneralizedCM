# GeneralizedCM
We present a unified framework for quantifying the side-channel resistance of the Generalized Code-based Masking (GCM). We call the GCM, which includes Direct Sum Masking (DSM), Leakage Squeezing (LS), Inner Product Masking (IPM), Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) based polynomial masking and also Boolean masking. 

A note of caution: the abbreviation GCM here should not be confused with the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM), which is a mode of operation for symmetric-key block ciphers (e.g., AES-GCM).
